This is a prototype implementation of a client
for discovery based APIs.

Installation
============

None. 

For the time being the required libraries
are checked into this directory to make 
developement easier, so you can just run
this directly after checking out.

Running
=======

First run three-legged-dance.py to get OAuth
tokens for Buzz, which will be stored in
buzz.dat in the working directory.

   $ python samples/cmdline/three_legged_dance.py

Then run buzz.py, which will use the apiclient
library to retrieve the title of the most
recent entry in Buzz and post a test message.

   $ python samples/cmdline/buzz.py
